    "\n",
    "**Finding:**\n",
    "- Q4 (October-November) generates **26% of annual revenue** (£2.6M)\n",
    "- November alone produces £1.46M—**85% above monthly average**\n",
    "- 79.4% repeat purchase rate drives **96% of revenue**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "The business has a **dual dependency**: seasonal demand peaks AND customer retention. This creates both opportunity and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Impact:**\n",
    "- **Opportunity:** Predictable Q4 surge enables strategic inventory planning\n",
